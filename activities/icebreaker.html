        <h1>Icebreaker</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The icebreaker for this course will be a bit different than what you
          may have experienced in the past. While there will be an element of
          introduction, we are less concerned with where you are from, and more
          concerned with your ability to think and contribute meaningfully to a
          conversation.
        </p>

        <h2>Post</h2>
        <p>
          Once you have formulated your thoughts post them in the icebreaker
          discussion board. Try to do this early in the week.
        </p>

        <h2>Reply</h2>
        <p>
          Later in the week read and reply to other posts. Focus on generating
          thoughtful responses. You are not evaluated on quantity here but on
          quality.
        </p>
        <h2>Review</h2>
        <p>

            proposing a project, and then either building a team for your
            proposal OR joining the team for someone else's project.</strong
