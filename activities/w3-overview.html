        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          By the beginning of this week you should have selected a plan that you
          will begin following. If you choose the Structured Plan (Plan 3) You
          should begin by
          <a href="../resources/plan-c.html" target="_blank"
            >reviewing the plan details</a
          >
          and begin executing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have chosen the Challenge (Plan 1) or Semi-structured (2) plans
          you need to assess if you are more interested in your project idea or
          someone elses. If you decide to pursue your idea then review the
          students who expressed interest in your plan. Follow up with them to
          build your team (if the project is a team project). Then with your
          team you should prepare a Charter and a Project Management plan.
