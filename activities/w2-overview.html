        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>By the end of the lesson, each student will:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Carry out a simple project.</li>
          <li>Explain and evaluate project ideas.</li>
          <li>Choose a path.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This week will give you the opportunity to learn about some of the
          different project management methodologies, and then plan a simple
          project using one of them. You will also need to come up with a
          project idea of your own and try to entice classmates to join your
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also review your classmates ideas...maybe one of them will
          have an idea that appeals to you more than your own does!
        </p>
