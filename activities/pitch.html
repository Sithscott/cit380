            <h1>The Pitch</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>Two of the three paths through this course will involve you planning and completing projects of your
                choosing. For this activity you should come up with a project idea of your own, and then 'pitch' it to
                your classmates to try and gain their interest in your idea. You will also read over your classmates
                ideas and respond to those that appear interesting to you.</p>
            <p>One of the best ways to pitch an idea is through an 'elevator pitch'.</p>



            <div class="callout">
                <p>So What is an Elevator pitch anyway?</p>
                <p>An elevator pitch is a brief, persuasive speech that you can use to spark interest in what you or
                    your organization does. You can also use one to create interest in a project, idea, or product.</p>
                <p> It needs to be succinct, while conveying important information.</p>
            </div>
            <p>The Final project for this class this semester will be for you to create a website on a topic of your
                choice. This week you need to start thinking about what you want to do. Creating an elevator pitch can
                be a good gauge of the quatlity of your ideas and your enthusiasm for them.</p>

                    <h3>The 9 C's of elevator pitches</h3>
                    <p>Review the 9 C's of an effective pitch from <a href="http://elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html"

                    <dl class="def-list">
                        <dt>Concise</dt>
                        <dd>An effective elevator pitch contains as few words as possible, but no fewer.</dd>
                        <dt>Clear</dt>
                        <dd>Rather than being filled with acronyms, MBA-speak, and ten-dollar words, an effective
                            elevator pitch can be understood by your grandparents, your spouse, and your children.</dd>

                        <dt>Compelling</dt>
                        <dd>An effective elevator pitch explains the problem your Solution solves.</dd>
                        <dt>Credible</dt>
                        <dd>An effective elevator pitch explains why you are qualified to see the problem and to build
                            your
                            Solution.</dd>
                        <dt>Conceptual</dt>
                        <dd>An effective elevator pitch stays at a fairly high level and does not go into too much
                            unnecessary
                            detail.</dd>
                        <dt>Concrete</dt>
                        <dd>As much as is possible, an effective elevator pitch is also specific and tangible.</dd>
                        <dt>Customized</dt>
                        <dd>An effective elevator pitch addresses the specific interests and concerns of the audience.</dd>
                        <dt>Consistent</dt>
                        <dd>Every version of an effective elevator pitch conveys the same basic message.</dd>
                        <dt>Conversational</dt>
                        <dd>Rather than being to close the deal, the goal of an elevator pitch is to just set the hook;
                            to
                            start a conversation, or dialogue, with the audience.</dd>

                    <h3>Examples</h3>
                    <p>Consider the following examples. Can you see the application of the 9C's in them?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>“I work with Computers”</li>
                        <li>“I’m a computer programmer”</li>
                        <li>“I make mobile applications”</li>
                        <li>"My company writes mobile device applications for other businesses."</li>
                        <li>"My company develops mobile applications that businesses use to train their staff remotely.
                            This results in a big increase in efficiency for an organization's managers."</li>
                        <li>"Think about the last online purchase you made. Did you need any instructions to do it? did
                            everything go smoothly? That’s what I do…I make websites and online storefronts that look
                            great and are so intuitive to use that people don’t need instructions or training to use
                            them. I do this for a wide variety of businesses."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <!-- END STEP  -->
                </li>

                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Create a pitch for your project idea.</h3>
                    <p>Create a 75-150 word pitch (about 60 seconds worth) for an idea that you would like to turn into
                        a project. You can use the following process to help:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Identify your idea or goal.</li>
                        <li>Explain what you want the project to accomplish.</li>
                        <li>Communicate your USP. (Unique Selling proposition)</li>
                        <li>Engage with a question</li>
                        <li>Put it all together. </li>
                        <li>Practice! Practice! Practice!</li>

                    </ol>

                    <!-- END STEP  -->
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Publish</h3>
                    <p>Once you have put your pitch together and <strong>practiced</strong> it. Share it with 3-4
                        people and get their
                        feedback. This sharing should be done asynchronously! (face to face or video conference
                        ideally) Then post your pitch and the feedback to
                        the Pitch discussion board. <strong>This should be done before Wednesday!</strong></p>


                    <!-- END STEP  -->

                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Review</h3>
                    <p>Once you have your pitch posted begin reviewing the ideas from your classmates. Consider
                        your level of interest in each project idea. What is likely to go right/wrong? Respond with
                        questions or ideas for full proposals you read. You should not respond to all projects, just
                        the ones you have legitimate questions and/or ideas and/or special interest. About a half dozen
                        or so. Don’t repeat questions.</p>
                    <p>For each project you are legitimately interested in you should also post to the thread your
                        interest in participating in the project. You may want to include strengths, interests,
                        availability, etc as part of your “application”.</p>
