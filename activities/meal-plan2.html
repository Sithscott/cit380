        <h1>Planning a Meal</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          If you have spent any time cooking for a large group, or preparing
          anything more complex than soup or sandwiches, you know that there is
          a lot of preparation that must be done and a lot of details to track
          for the meal to be a success. Planning and preparing a complex meal
          really is a very nice example of Project Management.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this activity you will choose a project management method and then
          plan a complex meal using it.
        </p>

              Begin by selecting a project management method (<a

              â€“ You can add your own to this list if you do not see it here). Do
              some research and reading on the method, and then describe it in
              your own words.

            <h3>Plan a Meal</h3>
            <p>
              Apply your understanding by describing how you would use your
              selected method to organize, prepare, deliver, and clean up a
              balanced meal for 3 or more people. Balanced means multiple food
              groups are represented, ie meat or other protein, vegetables,
              fruit, possibly grains or dairy, and an optional dessert. Review
              the following "charter" for more details.

              <p>Dear friend,</p>
              <p>
                Welcome to the neighborhood dinner club. We are excited to have
                you join. There is just one last requirement that must be met:
                you need to prepare and serve a meal to the managing board
                members. If you meal meets our expectations...you are in!
              </p>
              <p>Here are a few details you will need:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  You will host us at your place. Let us know what time we
                  should arrive. We will expect the meal to be served promptly
                  after our arrival. You should plan on at least three guests,
                  but can invite more if you would like.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The menu should be for a balanced meal, and should be prepared
                  mostly from basic ingredients...if you serve us Ramen or
                  Macaroni and Cheese it had better be home made and delicious!
                  It should involve some sort of protein, and good helpings of
                  fruits and vegetables. Dessert is optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexibility is important when hosting a dinner party. Bonus
                  points will be given if consideration has been given to
                  adaptation. Sometimes you get late cancels or commitments. How
                  will you accomodate these changes to make sure you have enough
                  food?
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                You will have the following responsibilities as the lead on
                this:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Schedule: Consider each phase of the meal: planning, shopping,
                  inviting, preparation (cooking and setup), eating, and
                  cleanup. Make you allow enough time for each phase.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Budget: The meal does not have to be gourmet or expensive. It
                  should be prepared mostly from scratch however. Keep it
                  simple. Make sure that it fits into your budget. Estimate the
                  costs for the meal once you have decided on the menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Communications: how will you keep me and everyone else
                  involved up to date on your progress and what they should be
                  aware of? How will you extend your invitations and allow for
                  RSVPs from each invitee?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Tracking: how will you keep track of your progress so you know
                  if you are on track to succeed?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Risks: what risks will you face? What could derail your plans
                  and cause the dinner to fail? How will you mitigate those
                  risks?
                </li>

                <li>
                  Planning: you should have a detailed plan to me no later than
                  then second week in the semester containing the information
                  above.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                I look forward to eating with you!

            <h3>Execute your plan</h3>
            <p>
              Once you have your plan made...execute it! You should follow the
              plan to actually invite 3+ people to dinner, prepare the meal for
              them, and then clean it up.
            </p>

            <h3>Post Mortem</h3>
            <p>
              At the end of a project it is useful to talk about how things
              went...what went well, what could have been improved, did you stay
              on budget both with time and money? This is often called a 'Post
              Mortem'. Evaluate your project and write up your own Post mortem.
              You might even consider getting your guests input on this as well.
            </p>
