        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Path B allows for students to still gain experience in becoming more
          proactive, but with more scaffolding to help them get started. They
          are given examples and ideas to help scaffold their project planning
          around. These projects can be completed as a group or individually.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >If done individually a Plan B student can get a maximum of 85%. If
            done as a group the maximum grade is 95%</strong

          After settling on a project to complete you should then put some
          research and thought towards which Project management methodology
          would best fit with your project plans. Google is your friend here, or
          here is a

          to get you started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methodology in hand, you should now prepare the Charter for your
          project and the project management plan. Your documentation list
          should include the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Project Charter</strong>:</li>
          <li><strong>Project Management Plan</strong>:</li>
          <li><strong>Schedule Management Plan</strong>:</li>
          <li><strong>Quality Management Plan</strong>:</li>
          <li><strong>Risk Management plan</strong>:</li>
          <li><strong>Communications Plan</strong>: (if done as a group)</li>
          <li><strong>Scope Management Plan</strong>: (if done as a group)</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Human Resources Management Plan</strong>: (if done as a
            group)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This list is somewhat open for negotiation. You can omit or add to it
          provided you support your changes with good rationale.
        </p>
        <p>
          All changes to the plan should be discussed and ultimately approved by
          the instructor.
        </p>

        <p>

          completed yours make sure to regularly update it as necessary while
          you execute the project.
