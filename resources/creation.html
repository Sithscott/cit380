          Principles of Project Management in the Creation and in the Scriptures
        </h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>
          Throughout the semester, my ultimate goal is to help you identify,
          understand, implement, and develop habits of living sound principles
          of effective project management. What is meant by principles? Elder
          Richard G. Scott provides one of the best definitions of which I know:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ...search for principles. Carefully separate them from the detail used
          to explain them. Principles are concentrated truth, packaged for
          application to a wide variety of circumstances. A true principle makes
          decisions clear even under the most confusing and compelling
          circumstances. It is worth great effort to organize the truth we
          gather to simple statements of principle. I have tried to do that with
          gaining spiritual knowledge. The result is now shared in hope that it
          will be a beginning place for your study. (<a

        <p>
          In preparation for our class discussion, please join me in searching
          for principles of project management from the accounts of one of the
          most significant projects that I am aware of, the creation of this
          earth. The bulk of these accounts are found in
          <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gen/1" target="_blank"
            >Genesis 1</a
          >, <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/gen/2" target="_blank">2</a>,
          <a
            href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/1/35-42#35"
            target="_blank"
            >Moses 1</a
          >,
          <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/3" target="_blank">3</a>,
          <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/3" target="_blank"
            >Abraham 3</a
          >, <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/5" target="_blank">5</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also want to attend the temple for additional insights. Other
          aspects of this project can be found throughout the scriptures and in
          the words of modern day prophets, so don't be afraid to use the
          topical guide or other sources as well. Search for principles of
          project management that we can use in accomplishing large scale
          projects involving coordinated work teams. Consider the following
          questions to help you get started, but please don't use a question and
          answer format for your paper:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How was the need for this project identified?</li>
          <li>What was the purpose or mission of this project?</li>
          <li>
            What was the scope of the creation project (did it have a start and
            finish - if so what were they)?
          </li>
          <li>How was the entire effort organized?</li>
          <li>
            What was the organizational structure like (who reported to whom)?
          </li>
          <li>
            How was the project plan created, refined, discussed, decided upon,
            and communicated?
          </li>
          <li>
            How was the progress or status of the project monitored and
            communicated?
          </li>
          <li>
            How was the success or failure of project tasks evaluated or
            approved?
          </li>
          <li>
            What were phases or divisions of the project? (was there more than
            one layer?)
          </li>
          <li>Were deadlines or time a factor?</li>
          <li>Was there a budget or costs associated with the project?</li>
          <li>
            Were there resources (people, tools, equipment, technology,
            materials, etc.) involved to achieve the project goals? You can also
            select and consider principles that you can learn from other
            projects in the scriptures such as:
          </li>
          <li>
            Nephi building the ship to come to the promised land (1 Nephi 17-18)
          </li>
          <li>
            Captain Moroni's "strategems" for particular battles (Alma 43-56)
          </li>
          <li>Plans for the building the Kirtland temple (D&C 109)</li>
          <li>Methods for moving the saints west (D&C 136)</li>
          <li>
            Leading the children of Israel out of Egypt and on to Canaan
            (Exodus)
          </li>
          <li>
            Building Solomon's temple (1 Chronicles 21, 2 Chronicles 26-27, 1
            Kings 6-8)
          </li>
          <li>Feeding the 5,000 (Matthew 14)</li>
        </ul>

          Please prepare a 1-page summary of <em>at least 3 principles</em>,
          patterns, practices, concepts, or ideas relating to project management
          you see at work in the creation of the world. Use the sample format
          below to organize your response.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Principle/Summary - short statement in your own words</li>
          <li>Description - further explanation</li>
          <li>
            Support - Specific reference(s), phrase(s), verse(s), or
            interpretations by modern day prophets.

        <h2>Example</h2>
        <p>Humility is essential to the acquiring of spiritual knowledge.</p>
        <p>
          To be humble is to be teachable. Humility permits you to be tutored by
          the Spirit and to be taught from sources inspired by the Lord, such as
          the scriptures. The seeds of personal growth and understanding
          germinate and flourish in the fertile soil of humility. Their fruit is
          spiritual knowledge to guide you here and hereafter. A proud
          individual cannot know the things of the Spirit. Paul taught this
          truth, saying:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          The things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.<br />
          â€¦But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God:
          for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because
          they are spiritually discerned (1 Cor. 2:11, 14).
