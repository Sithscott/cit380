        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The main focus of the Challenge path is to allow students to
          experiment deeply with the idea of "Acting and not being acted upon".
          You are given great flexibility with this path to determine everything
          about your project including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project management methodology</li>
          <li>Deliverables</li>
          <li>Milestones</li>
          <li>Assessment method (how your project should be graded)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The assessment piece in particular should be negotiated and ultimately
          approved by the instructor. A challenge path project should be a group
          project.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>
          A Project Management Plan (PMP) is a living document. Once you have
          completed yours make sure to regularly update it as necessary while
          you execute the project.
