        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The main focus of the Challenge path is to allow students to
          experiment deeply with the idea of "Acting and not being acted upon".
          You are given great flexibility with this path to determine everything
          about your project including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Project management methodology</li>
          <li>Deliverables</li>
          <li>Milestones</li>
          <li>Assessment method (how your project should be graded)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The assessment piece in particular should be negotiated and ultimately
          approved by the instructor. A challenge path project should be a group
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will be an expectation for your team to turn in a mid-project
          milestone report detailing your progress at the midpoint of your
          project, and a lessons learned report you will turn in at the end. The
          milestone report must be done no later than Week 6, the lessons
          learned report no later than week 12. Both of these can be completed
          much earlier if you are trying to finish the course early or are
          completing multiple projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          These status reports should be submitted to the
          <strong>Project Milestone Reports</strong> discussion board in ILearn.
          Include any important project documentation or other artifacts that
          will be needed to understand the full status of your project along
          with your milestone report.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>
          A Project Management Plan (PMP) is a living document. Once you have
          completed yours make sure to regularly update it as necessary while
          you execute the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will also be an expectation for you to review other student's
          projects. You can evaluate the projects either at the half-way point
          using the milestone mid-project report, or at the end using the
          lessons learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can determine the format of this review, or you can look at common
          project post-mortem templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start early on these reviews. Early feedback to the owners of the
          projects will be much more useful than late feedback. Likewise you
          should seek out early feedback on your project. Because of the way the
          course is structured there is no guarantee that your project will get
          reviewed by a peer. You can seek these out! From classmates, family,
          co-workers, instructors, peers, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The projects to review will be found in the
          <strong>Project Milestone Reports</strong> discussion board in ILearn.
          Post your review or post-mortem as a reply in that same place.
