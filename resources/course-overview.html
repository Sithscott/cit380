            <h1>Course Overview: Instructor</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of the semester, each student will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Be an effective communicator, team member, and leader (20%)</li>
                <li>Be proactive, able to operate in poorly defined or constrained situations (35%)</li>
                <li>Know how to create, coordinate, execute, and evaluate a project plan (20%)</li>
                <li>Be able to list and define the core principles of project management, identify and implement
                    multiple methodologies, and explain how they can be used to make a project successful (15%)</li>
                <li>Be self-regulated, life-long learners (10%)</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Course Description</h2>
            <p>This course introduces concepts, issues, approaches, tools, techniques, and technologies applicable to
                the management of projects. Projects can be defined as any temporary endeavor undertaken to create
                unique product, service, or result. The course explores how a manager can plan, organize, implement and
                control non-routine activities to achieve cost, schedule and performance objectives.</p>

            <p>Read carefully the outcomes above. Notice that #2 is ranked higher than any of the other outcomes. This
                course is designed to help students become more proactive...to learn to "Act and not be acted upon" It
                is important to keep this goal in mind when approaching this course. Make sure to remind the students
                of this outcome often.</p>
            <h2>Three Paths introduced</h2>
            <p>This course is structured to allow students three different paths of completion. We will label these
                paths as 'A', 'B', and 'C'. They will decide which path they would like to pursue by the end of Week 2.
                Your focus during this time will be to help them to decide which path is best for them. </p>
            <p>All projects will have a required mid-project and end of project report that students must complete. The
                mid report should happen no later than Week 6, the final report no later than Week 12.</p>
            <p>Make sure that the students understand that they may complete more than one project over the course of
                the
                semester should they choose. Completing many small to medium complexity projects can often be more
                valuable
                than one large project.</p>
            <h3>Path A</h3>
            <p>Path A allows the student the most flexibility and the most opportunity to show that they can take
                initiative and organize and plan a good project. The deliverables, milestones, and grading are owned by
                the students. Students working on plan A should do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop a project idea accompanied with a charter and Project Management Plan modeled off of things
                    they have researched and studied about project management best practices.</li>
                <li>Complete the proposed project as a group</li>
                <li>Develop and follow a project communication plan (part of the PMP)</li>
                <li>Develop an assessment plan (part of the PMP)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The Maximum grade for a Plan A student is 100%</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Path B</h3>
            <p>Path B allows for students to still gain experience in becoming more proactive, but with more
                scaffolding to help them get started. They are given a project charter and plan template to base the
                planning of their selected project around. These projects can be completed as a group or individually.
                The students must produce at least the following artifacts:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Project Charter</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Project Management Plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Schedule Managment Plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Quality Managment Plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Risk Managment plan</strong>: </li>
                <li><strong>Communications Plan</strong>: (if done as a group)</li>
                <li><strong>Scope Managment Plan</strong>: (if done as a group) </li>
                <li><strong>Human Resources Managment Plan</strong>: (if done as a group)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>If done individually a Plan B student can get a maximum of 85%. If done as a group the maximum
                    grade is 95%</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Path C</h3>
            <p>Not all students are prepared to become more proactive. Plan C provides a pre-built project with charter
                and Project Managment Plan. The project which the students will complete is to prepare to pass the PMI
                PMP exam.
                <p><strong>Because this plan does not require students to grow in the areas of outcomes one and two,
                        the maximum grade a Plan C student can achieve is 80%.</strong> </p>
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Changing Plans</h3>
            <p>A important thing to note and mention to the students. They can switch plans! If a student begins Plan C
                for example...but then takes the initiative to organize a group of other Plan C students to coordinate
                and work together towards a common goal they are showing progress on outcomes one and two...this would
                qualify them for a higher plan.</p>
            <p>Changing plans should be discussed with the professor. Either the student or instructor can initiate
                this conversation. </p>

            <h2>Time Consumption</h2>
            <p>The first three weeks of the semester will be the heaviest for the instructor. You will need to help the
                students choose a plan, project, and help advise them on putting their charters and PMPs together. You
                should be very active in the discussions and as available as you can be. After week three the required
                load on the instructor can drop significantly.</p>
