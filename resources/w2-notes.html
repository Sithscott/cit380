            <h1>Week 2 Teaching Notes</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By the end of the lesson, each student will:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Negotiate a project with a customer/sponsor </li>
                <li>Create a project charter</li>
                <li>Effectively communicate project ideas with peers and other potential </li>
                <li>Evaluate project proposals</li>

            </ol>
            <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>From this point on, the instructor has two roles: PMO and teacher. When communicating with the
                    students, make it clear which role you are working in. </li>
                <li>Set up a way for students to schedule appointments with you this week. Leave the end of the week
                    open for follow ups.
                </li>

            </ol>

            <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The instructor should be extremely available this week. Perhaps 3x a day. This is the most
                    high-touch week of the semester.</li>
                <li>Work with the students individually to help them choose a project, give advice on scope, help them
                    realize challenges, encourage them to pick projects which will help them meet their overall needs.
                    As part of this negotiation, watch for and reward student initiative. Negotiate grading contract.
                    Encourage students to pick a plan or augment a plan to get the highest potential grade. Let them
                    know that this is not set in stone. Emphasize that they are to take initiative. The more initiative
                    they show, the higher the potential grade. If students refuse to show initiative, then they are
                    shoe-horned into a pre-packaged plan. The instructor encourages students to not use a pre-packaged
                    plan but to, at least, adapt one. The more it is adapted, the higher the potential grade. </li>
                <li>Inform students of your office hours.</li>
                <li>Answer student questions via email, office hours, and Announcements discussion.</li>
            </ol>
