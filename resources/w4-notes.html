        <h1>Week 4 Teaching Notes</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>By the end of the semester, each student will:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be an effective communicator, team member, and leader</li>
          <li>
            Be proactive, able to operate in poorly defined or constrained
            situations
          </li>
          <li>
            Know how to create, coordinate, execute, and evaluate a project plan
          </li>
          <li>Be self-regulated, life-long learners</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Before the Lesson Begins</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Plan to have an all-hands meeting (recorded synchronous video
            meeting) or prepare a video recording. This can also be done as an
            announcement some weeks. Alternate. There should be two parts:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Summary of key take-aways from last week. Conversations you had
                with individual teams, themes you are noticing that multiple
                teams are struggling with, or another other advise related to
                the status of the overall class.
              </li>
              <li>
                Tales from the trenches: Tell a story that you feel will be
                helpful from your experience or from something you have
                witnessed. I would save these and recycle them for subsequent
                semesters as appropriate.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Because not all students will have a reason to check into Ilearn
            regularly, you will either need to require it specifically, or
            prepare an email group and send important class communications out
            that way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set up groups in I-Learn for each project if the project leader or
            the communication plan for a project needs it. Enroll the members of
            the projects to the respective groups. Project specific feedback,
            Questions, and such to the instructor go through this channel.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>During the Lesson</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Grade the charters.</li>
          <li>
            Be as involved in the various student projects as possible. Many
            will not be in Ilearn often, but they should have specified how they
            as a team will be communicating with you and each other. Tune in to
            these conversations as often as you can. Your role for most of the
            next 9 weeks will be mentor and advisor. There will be a light
            grading load for the most part. As students finish up projects they
            should produce a lessons learned report detailing how the project
            went and schedule an appointment with you to close it out. Set your
            schedule in advance so they can find a time that works for both you
            and them. Students will also be required to review a certain number
            of projects throughout the semester. Grade those as they trickle in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remind students as appropriate that projects and/or the course can
            be finished early. When you have the project close meeting focus on
            the habits they have developed, and the knowledge they have gained.
            Help them to understand that completion is not just ticking off all
            the boxes, but involves things like the student having developed the
            habit of continuous learning, and meeting the objectives of the
            course. Ultimately if they can show that they have met the course
            outcomes (or the outcomes from their assessment plan if they
            altered) they can be done.
          </li>
          <li>Inform students of your office hours.</li>

          <li>
            Answer student questions via email, office hours, and Announcements
            discussion.
          </li>
