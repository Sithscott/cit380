        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Plan C provides you with a planned project and all of the necessary
          documentation to complete it. It's purpose is twofold.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Prepare you to pass the PMI Certified Associate in Project
            Management (CAPM) exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide a model of a structured project as an example of the
            principles studied while preparing for the exam.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Plan C is given to you as a fully planned project and as written
          assumes a one person team. Because of this it does not provide good
          opportunities to show growth in the first two outcomes of the course:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be an effective communicator, team member, and leader, and</li>
          <li>
            Be proactive, able to operate in poorly defined or constrained
            situations
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For this reason the maximum grade possible on Plan C is 80%. This plan
          is adaptable however. If a student adapts the plan in a way that can
          allow progress on the above outcomes, they become eligible to advance
          to a higher plan and potentially earn a higher grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          All changes to the plan should be discussed and ultimately approved by
          the instructor.
        </p>

        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>
          A Project Management Plan (PMP) is a living document. You should
          review all of it's parts carefully, starting with the charter, so that
          you understand what is expected, and then you should also regularly
          update the plan as necessary while you execute it.
